```

Bulk linting:

## Content Management

### Posts & Pages

It's very simple:

1. Create an `.mdx` file
2. Add front matter and content
3. Place the `.mdx` file in `data/posts`, `data/pages`, or `data/books`

### Photo Management

When I export photos from Lightroom, I just want to drag-n-drop them into the `data/photos` folder, then let a computer deal with serving an optimized version to a user.

With that workflow in mind:

1. Photos _must_ be a **JPG** have [Exif data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)
2. Add your `.jpg` photos to `data/photos`
3. Your photo will be optimized at build time

### Photo Optimization

This blog uses Sharp, a Node.js module, in concert with Next.js' `<Image />` component for image optimization. At build time Sharp will optimize images, while preserving EXIF data, for you. This makes `<Image />` faster since it doesn't have to work as hard to optimize images in real-time.

You can also run `npm run optimize` to optimize all photos in `data/photos` and `public/blog/images` manually.

## Gotchas

**Tailwind `font-*` and `dark` styles do not work in CSS Modules.**

I don't know why. Instead, add the styles in the component and then use `cn()` to merge them.

```js
className={cn(styles.date, 'font-roboto dark:text-gray-100')}
```
