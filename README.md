## Setup

### ENV Variables

You will need two ENV variables in order to develop locally. Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE"
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS="UA-1234567-X"
```

### Optional: Pull ENV Variables from Vercel

If you have a project on Vercel, add the ENV variables show above to your "Project Settings" and then pull them down:

Link project w/ Vercel:

```bash
$ vercel link
```

Pull ENV variables:

```bash
$ vercel env pull
```

This will create a `.env` file on your local.

---

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Test a build prior to deployment:

```bash
yarn build && yarn start
```

Bulk linting via CLI:

```bash
yarn lint
```

---

## Content Management

It's very simple:

1. Create an `.mdx` file
2. Add front matter and content
3. Place the `.mdx` file in `__posts`, `__pages`, or `__books`
4. Build

That's it!

## Photo Management

Just drag and drop `.jpg` files into `__photos` then build.

---

## Storybook

Stories are written in `.mdx` ([learn more](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/mdx)) and should be placed in the same folder as the component.

Start Storybook:

```bash
$ yarn storybook
```

---

## Gotchas

**Tailwind `font-*` and `dark` styles do not work in CSS Modules.**

I don't know why. Instead, add the styles in the component and then use `cn()` to merge them.

```js
className={cn(styles.date, 'font-roboto dark:text-gray-100')}
```

**Storybook does support this website's dark mode.**

That's because Tailwind expects the `dark` class to be set on `<html>`, while Storybook's background toggle just swaps hard-coded CSS values in `<head>`.

To test dark mode, right-click to inspect the component's `<iframe>`. Add `class="dark"` to `<html>`.

**Storybook v6.1 does not support PostCSS 8**

They're working on it for Storybook v7. Because of this, do not upgrade PostCSS, AutoPrefixer, and TailwindCSS to `@latest`.

**Netlify CMS only works locally.**

When I try on production? I get a "configuration error". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
