## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node 14 and NPM 7
- A [Formium](https://formium.io/) token
- A [reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) site key

### Install

Use [create-next-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app) to get up and running quickly:

```bash
npx create-next-app gregrickaby-blog --example https://github.com/gregrickaby/gregrickaby-blog
```

### Setup ENV Variables

Create an `.env` file in the root of the project.

Add the following:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE"
```

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS="UA-1234567-X"
```

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMIUM_PROJECTID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```

```bash
FORMIUM_TOKEN="YOUR_FORMIUM_TOKEN"
```

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY="YOUR_SITE_KEY"
```

### Working with Next.js

Start local dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Test a build prior to deployment:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

Bulk linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Bulk formatting:

```bash

```

Bypass Lefthook:

```bash
git commit -m "my commit message" --no-verify
```

## Content Management

### Posts & Pages

It's very simple:

1. Create an `.mdx` file
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Add Front Matter and content. You can even import React components!
3. Place the `.mdx` file in `__posts`, `__pages`, or `__books`
4. Build
=======
2. Add front matter and content
3. Place the `.mdx` file in `data/posts`, `data/pages`, or `data/books`
>>>>>>> main

> The Front Matter slug _must_ match the blog post filename. This is because Next.js is querying data based on the post slug.

### Photo Management

When I export photos from Lightroom, I just want to drag-n-drop them into the `data/photos` folder, then let a computer deal with serving an optimized version to a user.

With that workflow in mind:

1. Photos _must_ be a **JPG** have [Exif data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)
2. Add your `.jpg` photos to `data/photos`
3. Your photo will be optimized at build time

### Photo Optimization

This blog uses Sharp, a Node.js module, in concert with Next.js' `<Image />` component for image optimization. At build time Sharp will optimize images, while preserving EXIF data, for you. This makes `<Image />` faster since it doesn't have to work as hard to optimize images in real-time.

<<<<<<< HEAD
> Photos _must_ be a `.jpg` and have [Exif data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)!
=======
You can also run `npm run optimize` to optimize all photos in `data/photos` and `public/blog/images` manually.
>>>>>>> main

## Gotchas

### TailwindCSS

Tailwind `font-*` and `dark` styles do not work in CSS Modules. Instead, add the styles in the component using `cn()` to merge them.

```js
className={cn(styles.date, 'font-roboto dark:text-gray-100')}
```
