Photos (and a video) from my annual duck hunting trip to Green Bay, WI.

The weather started out cool, however by Wednesday, the ice on the bay was getting thick. I was able to hunt with my Dad, cousin Ryan, Uncle Jon, and my best friend Chris.

It's taken 3 years to figure out how to hunt on the "big water", and given all the ducks that tried to decoy - we feel like we're finally doing it right.Â In total, we fired over 200 shells and hauled in a season best, 19 ducks. Next year, we will work on patience, accuracy, and acquiring a layout boat!

Watch my dad and Ryan miss this duck. They're hard to hit!
