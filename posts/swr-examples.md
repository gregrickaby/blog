[SWR](https://swr.now.sh/) is an awesome [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) library for remote data fetching, maintained by the team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). SWR stands for "[stale-while-revalidating](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861)", which means, SWR will attempt to load cached data (stale) first, and then fetch new data (revalidate) in the background.

I built a repo with some simple examples, check it out [on Github](https://github.com/gregrickaby/swr-examples)!
