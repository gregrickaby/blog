## Web Hosting

I'm busy. I don’t have time to worry about hosting. I could offer expensive managed hosting or try and save a buck with cheap shared hosting, _neither of which is going to help my clients win_.

Instead, I offer my clients the best of both worlds: DIY hosting with [**Digital Ocean**](https://m.do.co/c/94370f7c93dc) ($10 credit) managed by **[ServerPilot](https://www.serverpilot.io/?refcode=13ff6c5bd529)** ($25 credit). My clients get a super fast website, and I don’t have to fool with managing the server via the command line. Now that’s a win-win for everyone!

## Project Management

I work best with kanban boards, so for me and my clients **[Trello](https://trello.com/gregrickaby/recommend)** (free month of Trello Gold) provides the most value. Plus seeing cards move across the board is very satisfying!

To ensure that all of my client’s needs are captured, I trust **[Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/invite/3d73985c)** (additional 250 items) for jotting things down quickly during the discovery calls. Later, I revisit and reformat using **[Google’s G-Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/solutions/small-business/)** so I can share a professional document with my clients.

## Time Tracking/Billing/Invoices

**[Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/1-093732)** ($10 credit) quite literally turns time into money. It’s great for keeping track of how much time you’re logging and then turning those hours into invoices. In addition to the web app, Harvest also offers [Android](https://www.getharvest.com/apps-and-integrations/android), [iOS](https://www.getharvest.com/apps-and-integrations/iphone) apps, and [Chrome](https://www.getharvest.com/apps-and-integrations/chrome) and [Safari](https://www.getharvest.com/apps-and-integrations/safari) extensions.

Harvest also supports **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)** integration to get paid fast!

**Other Tools**

Image management and manipulation is hard. Client’s just want to upload a photo and let a computer figure out what looks best. That’s where **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/sdmwtcmx0150uau2kixo)** (extra 600MB of storage space, 60,000 images, 1,800 transformations and 1,200MB of monthly bandwidth) comes in.

I also leverage **[Buddy](https://buddy.works)** as my DevOps pipeline, because I don’t have the time (nor do I care) to babysit Jenkins.

**Full Disclosure**

The law says I have to be clear when I’m using affiliate links, so here’s my official policy:

If a product or service listed on this website has an affiliate program, you can bet that the link to the product or service is an affiliate link. You can also safely bet, that each affiliate link is owned by myself to help bring in some passive income. Finally, I would not put an affiliate link to a product or service if I wasn’t actively using it.
