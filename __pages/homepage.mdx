# Hey y'all, I'm Greg üëãüèª

I live in southeast Alabama with my beautiful wife [Tara](https://tararickaby.com) and our three kids-- Chase, Chloe, and Wyatt. I'm into [photography](https://gregrickaby.com/photos), the [Packers](https://www.packers.com/), [Disney](https://www.disney.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). From the time I built my first website in the late 90's, I‚Äôve been passionate about the web! Learn more about my credentials on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregrickaby/).

## At Work

I'm the Director of Engineering at [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/) where I oversee staffing, policy, wellness, continuing education, and provide technical guidance to our sales and marketing teams. I also help support the Project Management Office with resource allocation, and assist both the CEO and COO with planning and execution of engineering department goals.

## Books

I contract with [Wiley Global](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/) and in 2016 I wrote a children‚Äôs book titled, [_Creating a Website for Dummies, Jr._](https://amzn.to/34QAxAQ) I'm also the Technical Editor for _[WordPress for Dummies](https://amzn.to/37XCflU)_, _[Professional WordPress Plugin Development](https://amzn.to/2BgCg7i)_, and _[WordPress All-In-One For Dummies](https://amzn.to/37MMDLp)_.

## Contributions

Since discovering open source in the early 2000's, I've contributed several parts of the [WordPress ecosystem](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gregrickaby/), including speaking at [WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/). I've also contributed code to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook), and [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org).
