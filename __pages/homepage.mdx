# Hey y'all, I'm Greg üëãüèª

I live in south Alabama with my beautiful wife [Tara](https://tararickaby.com) and our three kids-- Chase, Chloe, and Wyatt. I was born in Green Bay, WI and am a [Packers Shareholder](https://www.packers.com/community/shareholders). From the time I built my first website in the late 90's, I‚Äôve been passionate about the web! Learn more about my credentials on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregrickaby/).

## At Work

I'm the Director of Engineering at [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/). There, I oversee engineering staffing, policy, wellness, continuing education, and provide technical guidance to our sales and marketing teams. I also help support the Project Management Office with resource allocation, and assist both the CEO and COO with planning and execution of engineering department goals.

## Books

In addition to writing, I also served as Technical Editor for, _[WordPress for Dummies 9E](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1119696976/ref=pe_41006280_506051420_pe_re_csr_ea_lm)_ (2021), _[Professional WordPress Plugin Development, 2E](https://amzn.to/2BgCg7i)_ (2020), and _[WordPress All-In-One For Dummies, 4E](https://amzn.to/37MMDLp)_ (2019).
