# üëãüèª Hey y'all, I'm Greg

A father of 3 with a job in tech who is always trying to learn something new! Everything from leadership skills, to landscape photography, to JavaScript. When I‚Äôm not working, I enjoy hangin' with the family and building hobby apps, which I host [on Github](https://github.com/gregrickaby?tab=repositories).

## Books

I contract with [Wiley Global](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/) and have written a children‚Äôs book titled, [_Creating a Website for Dummies, Jr._](http://gregslink.co/create-a-website-am) (2018). I also serve as Technical Editor on three other books, _[WordPress for Dummies 9E](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1119696976/ref=pe_41006280_506051420_pe_re_csr_ea_lm)_ (2021), _[Professional WordPress Plugin Development, 2E](https://amzn.to/2BgCg7i)_ (2020), and _[WordPress All-In-One For Dummies, 4E](https://amzn.to/37MMDLp)_ (2019).

## At Work

At my regular 9-5 job I serve as Director of Engineering for web development agency, [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/). There I oversee staffing, policy, wellness, continuing education, and provide technical guidance to our sales and marketing teams. I also help support the Project Management Office with resource allocation, the Business Development and Strategy departments with sales engineering, and assist both the CEO and COO with planning and execution of engineering department goals.

## Contributions

Since I discovered open source back in 2007, I've contributed to various areas of the [WordPress ecosystem](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gregrickaby/), such as core, plugins, themes, Gutenberg, and BuddyPress. I've also spoken at WordCamps and contribute to other big projects including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) and [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org). Finally, I also serve my community at [Wiregrass Church](https://wiregrasschurch.org).
