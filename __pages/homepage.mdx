## Hey y'all üëãüèª

I'm just an ordinary father of 3 with a job in tech and always trying to learn something new-- everything from leadership skills to playing music to JavaScript. When I‚Äôm not at work? I enjoy photography, working in the yard, and hanging out with my family.

### üë®‚Äçüíª At Work

As Director of Engineering at [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/) I oversee staffing, policy, wellness, continuing education, and technical guidance. I also help support the Project Management Office with resource allocation, the Business Development and Strategy departments with sales engineering, and assist both the CEO and COO with planning and execution of engineering department goals. Learn more about my professional credentials on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregrickaby/).

### üíª Contributions

I [contribute](https://profiles.wordpress.org/gregrickaby/) to various areas of the WordPress ecosystem, such as core, plugins, themes, Gutenberg, and BuddyPress, as well as speaking at WordCamps. I also contribute to other open-source projects including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [StorybookJS](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook), [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org), as well as dozens of [my own projects on Github](https://github.com/gregrickaby?tab=repositories). I also serve my community at [Wiregrass Church](https://wiregrasschurch.org).

### üìö Books

I also contract with the publishing company, [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/) and have authored a children‚Äôs book titled, [_Creating a Website for Dummies, Jr._](http://gregslink.co/create-a-website-am) (2018) and serve as Technical Editor on three other books, _[WordPress for Dummies 9E](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1119696976/ref=pe_41006280_506051420_pe_re_csr_ea_lm)_ (2021), _[Professional WordPress Plugin Development, 2E](https://amzn.to/2BgCg7i)_ (2020), and _[WordPress All-In-One For Dummies, 4E](https://amzn.to/37MMDLp)_ (2019).
