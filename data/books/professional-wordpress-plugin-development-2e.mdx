In the winter of 2019, I partnered with [Brad Williams](https://strangework.com/), [Justin Tadlock](http://justintadlock.com/), and [John James Jacoby](https://jjj.blog) to tech edit the 2nd edition of _[Professional WordPress Plugin Development](https://amzn.to/2BgCg7i)._

This significantly updated edition of _Professional WordPress Plugin Development_ addresses modern plugin development for WordPress, the highly popular content management system (CMS).

If youâ€™re using WordPress to create and manage websites, WordPress plugins are the software that can extend or enhance CMS functionality. This book offers guidance on writing plugins for WordPress sites to share or sell to other users.

You can purchase it [wherever books are sold](https://amzn.to/2BgCg7i).
