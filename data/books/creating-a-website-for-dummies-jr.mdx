In the winter of 2016, I partnered with Wiley and the For Dummies brand to write [_Creating a Web Site: Design and Build Your First Site!_](https://amzn.to/34QAxAQ)

Intended for kids between the ages of 7-11. The book focuses on the planning process behind creating a successful website. Special thanks to [Allison Tarr](https://allisontarr.com/) for providing technical editing services.

You can purchase it [wherever books are sold](https://amzn.to/34QAxAQ).
