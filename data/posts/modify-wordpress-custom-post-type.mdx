Today I was tasked with adding functionality to an existing custom post type. The problem was, the CPT was being registered in a plugin which I could not edit.

After some digging, I found there's a filter for that (found in [post.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.5.2/src/wp-includes/post.php#L1017)) which allows you to modify a custom post type, after it's been registered some other way.

```php
apply_filters( 'register_post_type_args', $args, $post_type );
```

Hooking into that filter, allowed me to pass additional options to an existing CPT:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Filter the Products CPT to register more options.
 *
 * @param $args       array    The original CPT args.
 * @param $post_type  string   The CPT slug.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function grd_client_filter_products_cpt( $args, $post_type ) {
 // If not Products CPT, bail.
 if ( 'products' !== $post_type ) {
  return $args;
 }
 // Add additional Products CPT options.
 $products_args = array(
  'has_archive' => true,
  'supports'    => array( 'title', 'editor', 'author', 'thumbnail', 'excerpt', 'custom-fields', 'page-attributes' ),
 );
 // Merge args together.
 return array_merge( $args, $product_args );
}
add_filter( 'register_post_type_args', 'grd_client_filter_products_cpt', 10, 2 );
```

Now "Products" has an archive, along with some other meta boxes in the post editor. Nice!
