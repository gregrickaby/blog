Some of you are like me: "frequent theme changer guy". Here's a trick I've learned to keep from having to re-write code every time I get bored with a theme: I use the "Must Use" Plugin.

## What's an MU Plugin?

> A "Must Use" Plugin is a perfect solution for setting up Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Google Analytics, and other important - but not necessarily "updatable" code, that would otherwise be lost upon a theme change.

The general consensus is: _CPT's & Taxonomies should not be handled at the theme level, but rather, at the plugin level._

An MU Plugin is code that cannot be deactivated or deleted unless you have sFTP access. Check out the history of [Must Use Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) and learn more at the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins)

## Why not create a normal plugin or use functions.php?

You could. But there are extra steps to get it activated if you're running a multi-site network. Furthermore, if others have access to the Plugins section of the WP Dashboard, there's a chance it could be deleted or deactivated by mistake. Worse, if you load up important things in `functions.php`, You'll lose everything if the theme changes.

By using an MU plugin, your code will always be "on", no matter what network, theme, or curious guest blogger might do otherwise!

## Ok, how do I create a "Must Use" Plugin?

1. You need to create a directory: `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`
2. Next, create a PHP file. You can name it anything you want. Mine is named `grd_functions.php`. The full path would look like:`/wp-content/mu-plugins/grd_functions.php`
3. Now add your code, save your file and upload

That's it! Really!

### How about an example?

Here is an example Must Use plugin:

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Must Use Functions
Plugin URI: https://gregrickaby.com
Description: This plugin contains important functionality that need to persist, even if the theme changes.
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Greg Rickaby
Author URI: https://gregrickaby.com
*/

namespace GRD;

/**
 * Place Google Analytics in the header.
 *
 * @author Greg
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
function google_analytics() {
?>
<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-1212017-87"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'UA-123456-78');
</script>
<?php
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'GRD\google_analytics', 9999 );
```
