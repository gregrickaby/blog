Because of the recent increase in attacks on WordPress, we were recently chatting about locking down `/wp-admin` and `wp-login.php`.

We discussed the [Limit Login Attempts](http://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/) plugin, which works really well. If a user fails to login after a certain amount of attempts, they are blacklisted for a period of time. But what if we did more?

## .htaccess

You could use `.htaccess` to **deny all traffic (except ours) based on IP address**. The code to "deny all" is pretty simple and easy to implement. Simply drop the snippet below into `.htaccess`_,_ and _change the IP address to yours._

This will block anyone from accessing both `wp-login.php` AND the WordPress dashboard.Â Don't worry, if your IP address changes, you can always edit it later using FTP. Here's an example:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*)?wp-login\.php(.*)$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*)?wp-admin$
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^101\.167\.112\.117$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [R=403,L]
</IfModule>

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare's Firewall is also a great way to lock down the WordPress Dashboard.
