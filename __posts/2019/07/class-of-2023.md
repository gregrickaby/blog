Chase starts the 9th grade at [Enterprise High School](https://www.enterpriseschools.net/site/Default.aspx?PageID=9) this fall. It's hard to believe that he’s going to graduate in 2023!

Chase will also be in the pit (with the rest of the frosh) playing the keyboard and other percussion instruments...and today was the first day of Band Camp. He arrived at 7:15 am, and I met him at EPAC for freshman orientation at 6:00pm. It was a long day for him to say the least.

When I caught up with him, he was dressed in shorts, a Marvel superhero shirt with his Nashville Preds cap turned backwards, and a neckerchief around his neck. He looked like he'd had quite a day.

"My calves hurt. My heels too." he said.

As we walked into the EPAC, he continued telling me about his day. I’m not gonna lie, I was feeling a bit nostalgic. Some of my fondest memories are from Band Camp.

Next, we listened to Principle Harrison give his talk about the upcoming school year.

27 credits to graduate by 2023

As we grabbed his schedule and walked the halls of this monster of a high school (largest square footage in the state!) I felt another wave of nostalgia.

Make no mistake, my freshman year was awful... but after I joined the basketball, football, and baseball teams I was no longer an outcast and things got a lot better.

That’s my advice to you, son. Try new things. Meet new people. That’s the only way you’ll find yourself!

Tara, your mom, and I are looking forward to being part of this new chapter in your life. We’re proud of you!

## Update

Chase has moved from keyboard, and asked to join the drum line!
