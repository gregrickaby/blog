Chase and I had just ridden [Rock 'n' Roller Coaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roller_Coaster_starring_Aerosmith) at [Disney's Hollywood Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Hollywood_Studios). He sat down, and I saw an opportunity to snap this. I lowered the red saturation a bit and ran the graduated filter over the sky.
