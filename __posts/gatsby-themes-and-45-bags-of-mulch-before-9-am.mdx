This morning I woke up at 4:15 for no good reason, and decided to take advantage of the quiet time, so I started a continuing education [course on Gatsby Themes](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring).

Gatsby, is something I'm trying nail down in an effort make myself more marketable as the web moves away from WordPress. I learned a few things, but after 90 minutes or so I was feeling pretty restless.

## Quick backstory

Back in May, we bought an entire pallet of mulch (75 bags). Shortly thereafter Tara and I put out 30 bags around our new swimming pool enclosure. The other 45 bags were for the front of the house, and have been sitting in the car port (making me feel guilty) all summer long. To be fair, it has been hot as hell.

## Today

When I finished my cont. edu course, it was about 6am and the sun was starting to come up. The temperature was surprisingly cool, only 65F.

I figured since I'm up and feeling restless, I might as well go spread some mulch. By 8am, this was the result:

Honestly, I could use another 50+ bags to finish up around the house, and even some trees. It does feel good though to finally those bags of mulch out where they belong. ??

Now, if I could just get the darn grass to grow...
