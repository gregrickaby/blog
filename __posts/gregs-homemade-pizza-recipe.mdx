I love making homemade pizza. It's been a "Sunday staple" at our house for quite some time. Over the years, I've created a sort of Sicilian and Neapolitan style hybrid. This happened by accident when trying to copycat a Mellow Mushroom recipe. Personally, I love the chewiness of a Neapolitan, and the flavor of a Sicilian - and this dough brings the two together wonderfully. Yields two 12-14 inch pizzas.

## Day 1: Activate Yeast

- 1 1/2 cup (355 g) of Spring Water
- 1 tsp (4 g) of Sugar
- 2 tsp (6 g) of Active Dry Yeast (Instant works too)

### **Directions**

OK, the photos show Instant Yeast. And it works, but you're not really supposed to hydrate Instant Yeast (that's why it's "instant"). I recommend using Active Dry Yeast instead...

[![In the microwave, warm the water to 110˚F (43˚C).](/blog/images/2014-02-09-09.38.39-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-09.38.39.jpg)

In the microwave, warm the water to 110˚F (43˚C).

[![Add both the sugar and yeast.](/blog/images/2014-02-09-09.39.08-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-09.39.08.jpg)

Add both the sugar and yeast.

[![Making sure both are well combined.](/blog/images/2014-02-09-09.40.18-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-09.40.18.jpg)

Making sure both are well combined.

[![Let the yeast mixture sit 5-10 minutes until it blooms 1/2 - 1 inch.](/blog/images/2014-02-09-10.06.45-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-10.06.45.jpg)

Let the yeast mixture sit 5-10 minutes until it blooms 1/2 - 1 inch.

[![The head should be frothy!](/blog/images/2014-02-09-10.06.51-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-10.06.51.jpg)

The head should be frothy!

## Pizza Sauce

A large batch of Pizza Sauce is really easy to make! You can knock it out while the Yeast is activating and throw it in the freezer. Also, don't simmer the pizza sauce on a stove like Grandma used too, that's actually wrong!

Canned tomatoes are cooked while being canned AND you're going to cook the sauce on a pizza, in a 550F oven. So, do your sauce a favor and don't cook it _third time_ on the stove top. (Sorry Granny!)

Making the sauce on Day 1, will ensure all the ingredients have a chance to combine and mingle, resulting in maximum flavor.

- 20oz can of Crushed Tomatoes
- 4oz can of Tomato Paste
- 2 teaspoons Sugar
- 2 teaspoons Sea Salt
- 3/4 teaspoon Black Pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon Red Pepper
- 1/2 teaspoons Garlic Powder
- 1 teaspoon Basil
- 2 teaspoons Oregano

### Directions

Step 1: Combine ingredients in a large bowl.

Step 2: Stir until well combined.

Step 3: Put about 4oz of sauce on your pizza.

Storage: Store leftover sauce in small Tupperware containers. Place them in the freezer.

On your next pizza night, take a Tupperware container out of the freezer a several hours before dinner, and let it thaw to room temperature. **Never put cold pizza sauce on a pizza!**

## Pizza Dough

- 4 cups (560 g) of Bread or 00 flour
- 1 1/2 tsp (7 g) Kosher or Sea Salt

## Pizza Dough Prep

_This is where it will differ from household to household. I've spent entirely too much money on pizza baking kitchen goodies, like a high quality pizza stone, pans, peel, a roul'pat, etc. This is my hobby, and worth the extra expense. I will provide basic instructions. Please feel free to make-it-your-own at this point and have fun!_

[![Pre-heat your oven as high as it goes. (Mine goes to 550˚F, professional pizza ovens and wood fire grills are 1,000˚F). Crank it up!

[![Place the dough on the peel. Melt some butter and add 1 tsp of garlic powder or garlic salt.](/blog/images/2014-02-09-17.19.37-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-17.19.37.jpg)

Place the dough on the peel. Melt some butter and add 1 tsp of garlic powder or garlic salt.

[![Spread the garlic butter on the outer edge of the crust.](/blog/images/2014-02-09-17.19.49-1280x720.jpg)](https://gregrickaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-02-09-17.19.49.jpg)

Add your toppings. The faster you top the pizza, the less likely it is to stick to the peel. Pro-top: use a fork to pop any of the larger remaining air bubbles. Sure, they look at cute now, but they will cause GIANT bubbles in your pizza while baking.

### Cook That Pie!

## FAQ

**Q)** Why spring water?
**A)** Because tap water contains chlorine, which inhibits yeast. If you don't have any, it's OK...this time.

**Q)** Why bread or 00 flour?
**A)** Because pizza dough needs to be stretchable. The higher protein content in these flours makes the dough stronger and more playful. I recommend [Antimo Caputo 00 Pizzeria Flour](https://amzn.to/2WNqVnS).

**Q)** My dough won't rise!?
**A)** It's either because your yeast is dead, there is too much salt, or it has nothing to eat. Yes, you can kill yeast. Salt inhibits yeast. Sugar is yeast's favorite food. Give the yeast a treat, man!

**Q)** Why the rising overnight? I'm hungry now.
**A)** Yeast eats sugar and poops carbon dioxide/alcohol. Yeast droppings force the dough to rise and give it flavor. _The more time we give the yeast to eat and poop, the better your dough will taste._ If you can't wait, have one delivered!

**Q)** Why is the oven so hot?
**A)** High heat is how we achieve a crisp crust with a chewy center. Cooking slow at a low temperature would result in a soggy, limp pizza. Yuck!

**Q)** What pizza stone do you use?
**A)** [Emile Henry](https://amzn.to/2UFKLP1)

**Q)** What about your pizza peel?
A) [Norpro](https://amzn.to/2QQypT6)

Q) And that cool looking silicone mat?

## Further Reading

Over the years I've read a lot of books, blog posts, and watched many YouTube videos trying to hone the craft. One of the most influential pizzaiolis is 13-time World Pizza Champion, [Chef Tony Gemignani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gemignani). His book [_The Pizza Bible_](https://amzn.to/3dvvwRD) has inspired me more than most.

I would also highly recommend reading Peter Reinhart's, [_Artisan Breads Ever Day_](https://amzn.to/2UK9l1v) and Ken Forkish's [_Flour Water Salt Yeast_](https://amzn.to/2JkpMfr) to really gain a deep understanding into why these simple ingredients are so wonderful together, or as I call it "Bread Porn".

Good luck!
