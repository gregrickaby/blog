I love a good flow chart. So a few years ago, (while I had a cold) I was looking through our medicine cabinet at all the different pills and syrups and was a bit confused by all the claims on the boxes.

Determined, I did some research on what the best (over the counter) medicine was for each symptom. So, while laying in bed getting over a cold, I came up with the following information and flow chart.

**Stuffy Nose?** -> Loosen your snot with *Sudafed* (phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine)

**Cough?** -> An expectorant will help. Get some *Robitussin* or *Mucinex* (guaifenesin) Note: Robitussin brand cough syrup also contains many of the medicines below. See bottle for details.

**Fever? Sore Throat? Aches?** -> Alternate between _Advil_ and *Tylenol* (ibuprofen/acetaminophen)

**Runny Nose? Sneezing? Water Eyes?** -> You need an antihistamine. _Benadryl_ or _Allegra_ or _Claritin_ (diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine or fexofendadine hydrochloride or loratadine) should block them annoying histamines.

**Natural Remedies** -> Vitamin C, zinc, honey, hot tea, chicken broth, and plenty of liquids to stay hydrated.

**Greg’s Cold Medicine Routine** -> Emergen-C (vitamin c + zinc), and _Theraflu_ (which covers all the above medicines in hot liquid form which, A) helps the body absorb them fast B) helps ease a sore throat)

Get well soon!
