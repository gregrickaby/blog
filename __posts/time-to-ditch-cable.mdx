Most of you know we just moved. I was very happy with Charter in Montgomery. We had 3 brand-new HD-DVRs each with 1TB drives, 30/4Mbps un-throttled Internet that [would burst to over 60Mbps](http://www.speedtest.net/result/2724151093.png), plus over 100 HD channels (all with excellent picture quality). Best of all, I didn't pay any silly fees. I paid for the channels, premium channels, Internet, and only $14.99 for all three DVR's. Total, I was paying $188 a month with Charter.

Here in the subdivision, Time Warner is the only provider. When we first moved in, I wondered why almost every house had a satellite dish mounted to it. Well, I quickly found out.

\- Time Warner offers exactly 20 "HD" channels. I say "HD" loosely because technically it *is* 720p. Crisp? No. Grainy from compression? Yes. Honestly, there is little difference between the SD and HD channels.

\- This DVR is circa 2005, might have a 40GB hard drive, took the installing technician 2 hours AND a trip back to headquarters to get working.

\- What about the on-screen channel "guide"?  I'm pretty sure  the "guide" got totally wasted at a party because he's either completely blank, or displays inaccurate channel listenings. Last night for example, I clicked "Big Bang Theory" and instead Mr. Guide gave me Family Guy! Wee!

\- The Internet has been fine. Although, I did have to [hack around to un-throttle](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/196239/block_time_warner_cable_stream_throttling/) Netflix and YouTube.

Well, whatever. I have little choice in the matter. I'll deal with. I realize we went from a city with 200,000+ people down to 26,000. I get it. Time Warner is a little behind.

That was until I got this in the mail:

$0.36 per remote? $2.79 to have a drunk on-screen guide...oh wait another $4.75 for the on-screen guide? (I must be paying his bar tab) And WTF is this $14.34 charge for "Extreme Internet Add-On"? It's only 30/5Mbps!

Talk about getting nickeled and dimed...DirecTV is looking real awesome right now. Buh Bye Time Warner. I barely got to know you.

**UPDATE**

So, I head on down to Time Warner at lunch. I want to talk to someone about just having Basic Cable and Internet. The lady behind the counter starts mashing buttons on her calculator and says, "Basic cable...that's channels 2-63...and Extreme Internet (30/5Mbps)....that comes out to $167.89 per month".

I just look at her like she's stupid, and said "How, when I'm paying $176 now?"

Turns out, I'm the one who's stupid because the above prices on my bill are promotional; and as of June 2014 they would have gone up. _Way up._

Instead, I turned in the equipment and canceled cable TV (even basic) went with the $67 (20/2Mbps) Internet package, but am shopping for Wireless alternatives...

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE CABLE PROVIDER IN A SMALL TOWN AND IT'S NO WONDER PEOPLE ARE CANCELING CABLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
