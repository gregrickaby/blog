I have _Individual Blue_ from Blue Cross Blue Shield. It's a health insurance plan for the self-employed and is a no frills, high deductible, catastrophic, "oh f#@& I just lost my left leg" kind of thing.

Why do I have it? Because in 2008 I ventured out on my own as a freelancer, and this plan _covered my entire family for a mere $297 per month_.

This plan was lucky enough to be "grandfathered in" under the Affordable Care Act. Quite honestly, it's terrible insurance. I pay out the rear for co-pays, prescriptions, and had to pony up $2,000 (out of pocket) so Tara could [give birth to Chloe](https://gregrickaby.com/hello-chloe-grace/) - BUT HEY! IT'S HALF THE PRICE OF ANYTHING ELSE!

Three things have changed in the last 6 years:

1. Added dental in 2010
2. Added a dependent in 2014 (Chloe)
3. My premium has risen from $297 -> $615

Why?

Why has my coverage remained the same, but my premium more than doubled in just SIX YEARS!? The inflation rate in this time span is 8.2%. But my insurance premium has risen 55%? Can someone help me understand how this is fair? Dave Ramsey says it's basic math:

This is simply not sustainable! Furthermore it's now ILLEGAL to NOT have this. It's extortion really.

I fear the day Blue Cross Blue Shield drops our plan - and we have to actually go buy insurance on the marketplace. God help us all.
