In around 15 you could migrate your WordPress blog to the JAMStack Before you jump in, you're going to need a few things:

- Some familiarity of the command line
- [Node v12+](https://nodejs.org)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A [Github](https://github.com/) repository
- A JAMStack hosting account. Either [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) work, both are free
- ~15 minutes

## Step 1: Export your blog posts

WordPress makes it easy to export your data to an `*.xml` file. In the WordPress dashboard go to `Tools --> Export`. Select **All content**, then smash the download button.

Place the `*.xml` file somewhere easy to find, like `/Downloads`. Rename the file something easy to spell like, `export.xml`.

## Step 2: Convert your blog posts to Markdown

There's an awesome NPM package called [WordPress Export To Markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) by Will Boyd. This package will convert the contents of `export.xml` into markdown _and_ download all the images to your computer. It even comes with a handy wizard to make the conversion a breeze.

**Use NPX to start the conversion:**

```bash
$ npx wordpress-export-to-markdown
```

**Now answer the wizard's questions:**

**Optional folder structure:**

Gatsby supports using folders as a permalink, so I opted for the `year/month/blog-post-slug/` folder structure while answering the wizard's questions, but you can do whatever you want! Here's a peek at the structure:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ 2017
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2016-a-year-in-review
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ creating-a-website-for-dummies-jr
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 06
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ podcasting-sound-like-a-radio-dj
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ index.md
```

## Step 3: Create a Gatsby Blog

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that is pre-configured to work with the official Gatsby blog theme and supports MDX.

**Clone down the blog starter:**

```bash
$ gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

## Step 4: Move your Markdown into Gatsby

The Gatsby starter creates a couple of dummy posts, delete them! They're in the `content/posts` folder. Then drag and drop the `/Downloads/posts` folder you generated with the wizard into `/content`:

![](/blog/images/move-posts-to-gatsby.gif)

## Step 5: Configure Gatsby (Optional)

If you are in a hurry, skip this step. You can always come back to it later.

**Open up `gatsby-config.js` and customize:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-blog`,
      options: {}
    }
  ],
  // Customize your site metadata:
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Greg's Blog`,
    author: `Greg Rickaby`,
    description: `Blog posts so that I don't have to remember.`,
    social: [
      {
        name: `twitter`,
        url: `https://twitter.com/gregrickaby`
      },
      {
        name: `github`,
        url: `https://github.com/gregrickaby`
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Open `src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/bio-content.js` and customize:**

```javascript
import React, {Fragment} from 'react'
import {Styled} from 'theme-ui'

export default () => (
  <Fragment>
    Director of Engineering{' '}
    <Styled.a href="https://webdevstudios.com">@WebDevStudios</Styled.a> /
    Author & Editor{' '}
    <Styled.a href="https://www.wiley.com/">@WileyGlobal</Styled.a>
  </Fragment>
)
```

**Place your favorite selfie in `content/assets/` overwriting `avatar.jpg`**

```bash
content
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ avatar.jpg
â””â”€â”€ posts
```

That should be it for now. You can certainly customize Gatsby to your liking, but that's outside the scope of this blog post.

## Step 6: Start the Gatsby dev server

```bash
$ gatsby develop
```

This will verify that Gatsby can parse all the markdown files and create posts. Gatsby is also going to optimize images for the first time. This could take a while, depending on how many images you have!

## Step 7: Commit your changes and push to Github

Because Gatsby more-or-less clones down the stater, Git is already initialized.

**Make sure you're in the root directory of your new blog, then add your Github repo:**

```bash
$ git remote add origin git@github.com/username/your-repo
```

**Commit your changes and push**

```bash
$ git add . && git commit --message "initial commit" && git push
```

Your repo should look like this:

![github-repo-with-initial-commit](/blog/images/github-repo-with-initial-commit.png)

## Step 8: Setup hosting

For this example, I'm going to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) because I already have several projects hosted there. You could totaly use Netlify or any other JAMStack host that supports Github integration.

**Once you've signed up (or signed in), you can import a project**

![import-project-into-vercel](/blog/images/import-project-into-vercel.png)

**Under "From Git Repository" click "Continue"**

![select-from-git-repo](/blog/images/select-from-git-repo.png)

**Click "Import Project from Github" and select the Github repo you just pushed to. Click "Import"**

![select-your-git-repo](/blog/images/select-your-repo.png)

Vercel will automatically figure out this is a Gatsby site. Just click "Ok" and wait for the build to complete.

Once it's done, you can point your DNS at your new JAMStack blog. ðŸ’ª
