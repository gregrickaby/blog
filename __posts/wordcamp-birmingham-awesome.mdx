This was my second WordCamp (of any kind), the first being WordCamp San Francisco just a few weeks ago.  I wanted to list out the key differences between camps:

- WCSF had somewhere between 800-1,000 people. It was mega.
- WPYALL was just over 200 people. It was very intimate.
- At WCSF, I was kind of "in awe" of all that was happening around me. Every time I turned around there was a "celebrity" (hey, they're celebrities to me) and a dozen people huddled around them asking questions.
- At WPYALL, the same celebrities were there, but were much more approachable.

The smaller setting was much more my style. Some really cool things happened:

- [Lunch](https://twitter.com/karimmarucchi/status/371323198677479424) with [Lema](https://twitter.com/chrislema), [Marucchi](https://twitter.com/karimmarucchi), and [Norcross](https://twitter.com/norcross) (and Lema paid).
- SEO talk with [Robert Neu](https://twitter.com/realFATmedia) and swapping stories about scary babies and road trips with [Nickie O'Brien](https://twitter.com/FATmediagirl).
- Drink PBR's with [Otto](https://twitter.com/otto42) and have an hour long (non-WP) conversation about Android, beer laws, Memphis, and how all code is basically shit.
- Talked politics, religion, gun control, AND education reform with [William P. Davis](https://twitter.com/williampd), [Norcross](https://twitter.com/norcross), and [Thomas Griffin](https://twitter.com/jthomasgriffin).
- Called [Brian Krogsgaurd](https://twitter.com/Krogsgard) a dick for not following me on Twitter. (It was all in good fun and he DOES follow me).
- Embarrassed myself in front [Sara Cannon](https://twitter.com/saracannon) (I was the ONLY ONE still wearing a name badge at the after party).
- Plus, many more interesting conversations with [Doug Cone](https://twitter.com/nullvariable), [David Laietta](https://twitter.com/davidlaietta), [Kevin Dees](https://twitter.com/kevindees), and the guys from [Sideways8](https://twitter.com/sideways8com).

It all happened and was pretty amazing.

_But the highlight of the WPYALL?_

I sat down behind the help desk to just to chat with [Rachel Carden](https://twitter.com/bamadesigner), and ended up helping a half a dozen people over the course of an hour. It blew _my_ mind that I blew _their_ minds with things I do with WordPress daily - that seem daunting to them. (One lady, had no idea you could copy/paste text into the post editor!)

I'll definitely be attending and volunteering next year and have already joined the [Birmingham WordPress MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/Birmingham-WordPress-Meetup/).

Thanks to the organizers ([Brian Krogsgaurd](https://twitter.com/Krogsgard), [Andrew Searles](https://twitter.com/acsearles), and [Sara Cannon](https://twitter.com/saracannon)) for their hard work. I had a great time!
