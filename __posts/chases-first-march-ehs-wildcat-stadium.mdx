The city of Enterprise takes [high school football](http://www.southeastsun.com/sports/article_4c5dee60-f8ce-11e8-9ac5-a7d86114f9d9.html) very seriously, and the Big Blue Marching Band is a huge part of the program.

Just to get you caught up, Chase has been at [band camp](https://gregrickaby.com/2019/08/band-camp-2019/) since July. He started with the rest of the freshman, down in the pit playing drums/keyboard, but halfway through camp was asked to join the drum line and play cymbals.

Tara and I volunteer with the band boosters, so we arrived early to get water, nachos, and uniforms ready. It was a lot of fun to be "part of the action" and give back to our community. The atmosphere was electric last night!

We're so proud of everyone in the Band, and especially Chase for working so hard all summer! The Big Blue Marching Band sounds great!
