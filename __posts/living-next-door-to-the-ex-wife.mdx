In January 2010, I started as Chief Engineer at Bluewater Broadcasting. The new job required me to move to Montgomery, Alabama (about 2 hours from my son Chase). It’s been a very difficult 3 years, 5 months, and 19 days – not only for me, but Chase as well.

Now that I’m done at Bluewater, we’re moving back to southern Alabama. In-fact we’re moving into a house right next door to Chase.

**Both Tara and I are looking forward to being part of his day-to-day life again. One question we keep getting asked is, “How does Tara feel about living next door to your ex-wife?”**

The truth is: my ex-wife and I haven’t so much as looked at each other funny in over 5 years. In fact, before the divorce was final both the ex-wife and I agreed to _never let our personal feelings get in the way of our first priority: Chase_.

Besides, we both re-married...and she’s the one who found the house next door.

Both Tara (my wife) and Erin (the ex-wife) were raised in broken homes. They know first hand the incredible amount of B.S. kids must endure when dealing with divorce .

**So, “Yes”. Tara is “cool” with living next door to my ex-wife. She doesn’t look at the situation negatively. We’re all adults here, and besides our kids are watching.**
