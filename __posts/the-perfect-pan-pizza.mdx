### Pan Pizza Dough

- 4 cups of bread flour
- 1/4 oz active dry yeast
- 1 Tsbp of sugar
- 1 1/2 Tbsp of salt
- 1 1/2 cups of warm water
- 2-3 Tbsp of olive oil

1\. Add yeast and sugar to warm water. Stir. Let sit 15 minutes.

2\. While waiting, add salt to flour and mix.

3\. When the yeast mix is ready, pour into flour and mix. Add olive oil. Continue mixing until dough pulls away from the bowl.

4\. Knead with dough hook 3-5 minutes.

5\. Remove and with your hands, turn pizza dough into a ball.

6\. Apply a little olive oil to the inside of a large bowl. Set ball of dough in bowl, cover with towel, and let it rise at room-temperature for 3 hours. When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Re-cover for 1 more hour.

### Pizza Sauce

- 16 oz can of petitie diced tomatos
- 8 oz can of tomato paste
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1/2 Tsbp salt
- Oregano (to taste)
- Basil (to taste)
- Pepper (to taste)

1\. In a medium sauce pan over low heat, add everything but the Oregano, Basil, and Pepper.

2\. After sauce has simmered a few minutes, mix in the spices to taste. Freeze leftovers.

### Bake the Pan Pizza

1\. Pre-heat oven to 500F.

2\. Pour 2-3 tbsp of olive or soybean oil into the bottom of a cast-iron pan, cake pan, or deep-dish pizza pan. Put dough in pan and press it down.

3\. Lightly spread olive or soybean oil on the edges. You could also substitute for "butter flavored" Pam (this is what Pizza Hut does).

4\. Add enough sauce to cover dough. The thicker the dough, the more sauce you can add without it becoming soggy.

5\. Add mozzarella cheese, and lots of it. Don't be afraid to put cheese all the way to the edge -that's how you get that awesome "crusty cheese"!

6\. Add pepperoni, and other toppings of your choosing.

7\. Place pan on pizza stone on bottom rack, bake for 10-13 minutes. Keep an eye on it. When it looks "done", take it out. Let it cool for 5 minutes. Remove from pan.

8\. Cut. Serve. Enjoy!
