As Sass and Grunt become more and more popular, the demand for such tools while customizingÂ themes increases. This is true with the Genesis Theme as well. A while back I forked the Genesis Sample Theme and "sassified" it (yes, that's a word!). Since then, more and more folks have been pinging me about adding Grunt.

So I did.
