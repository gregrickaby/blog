While on vacation in the Northwoods of Wisconsin, we took a drive over to Escanaba, Michigan. While there, we walked around [Sand Point Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Point_Light), which is one of four lighthouses in Delta County.

Unfortunately, both the lighthouse and its museum were closed due to COVID-19, but it was still a nice visit and I grabbed this shot.
