Where to begin? A global pandemic, lock-downs, corrupt politicians left unchecked, an election shrouded in turmoil. From a global and national vantage point, it honestly felt like 2020 would never end. Personally, we had a pretty good year. I already work from home and Tara is a stay-at-home mom...as one of my friends stated (in reference to being locked-down), "Y'all we're built for this..." Indeed we are. 

## Family life

### Wyatt (4)

Still rambunctious and 2020 saw him finally becoming fully potty trained. He still loves dinosaurs, heavy machinery, and "Mando" from *The Mandalorian*. Wyatt doesn't really stop talking, ever! (haha) and is drawing people (as stick figures) and can use scissors, glue, and other craft stuff. He's a great kid with a big heart who is ferocious protective when it comes to his family.

Wyatt tried playing soccer, however, that was cancelled due to COVID. We were all bummed out, by that...however we signed him up for acrobatics class at Center Stage. He loves doing that, we're excited to see his recital in the spring!

### Chloe (6)

Still dancing and has participated in her 3rd consecutive year with the company at [Center Stage](https://www.centerstagedanceal.com/). Even amid a pandemic, the company traveled to Montgomery, Mobile, and Biloxi to compete at dance competitions. 

Those dance competitions had to be completely overhauled to meet social distancing requirements. My favorite part was the grouping of companies in a single time slot. This mean committing to a few hours on a one day, instead of spread across a 3-day weekend.

Tara and I decided to homeschool this year, we just felt like it was the right choice during the pandemic, plus Tara has the credentials to do so. It hasn't been easy, but Chloe is learning a lot and getting good grades!

### Chase (15)

Still drumming... except now he's on drumming for Enterprise High School's "Big Blue Band". He also got his learner's permit, however, has shown almost no interest in driving. He spends most of his time with video games including Red Dead 2, Skyrim, Assasin's Creed Valhalla, and Animal Crossing. When he's not playing video games or in school, he's on Instagram chatting away in DM's. 

Chase did get COVID though...it spread throughout his mother's house. Thankfully, his symptoms were mild and he was able to recover and is doing fine.

## Personal Accomplishments

I've always been interested in photography, but what really got me going was rebuilding Tara's store for [Crotchet Creations](https://tararickaby.com). Built from the ground up using WordPress, Beaver Builder and WooCommerce. As such, we knew that high-quality photos help move inventory. So, I learned on a new hobby in 2020: Photography. I took dozens of LinkedIn Learning courses and read 8 different books about the subject. I also purchased a couple mirrorless cameras and some gear, including some really nice glass. Photography has become another creative outlet for me and it's always fun to get up early and go shoot a sunrise. Check out some of [my favorite photos](https://gregrickaby.com/photos).

In addition to going all-in on Photography, I've also gone all-in on JavaScript. By the time we were locked down, I was going full tilt learning JavaScript and React. Almost every hobby app I've shipped since then, has been built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I became a contributor to docs, and the WordPress and Blog Starter examples!

I also continued to "pause" my social media, really only spending time on Twitter and Reddit...the bulk of which was in November as I doom-scrolled through the elections. I also deactivated both my Facebook and Instagram accounts. 

As far as playing Bass for Wiregrass Church? I was the regular player up until COVID-19 shut down our church last spring. I'm a little sad to say, I haven't really picked it up and have since focused on photography. As soon as things get back to normal, I'll probably start playing again!

## Professional Accomplishments

### At WebDevStudios

Early on, one of my engineering managers had some major health issues. He's doing a lot better now (which is amazing, he's truly a remarkable human being) but these issues caused him to miss the first half of the year. I had to fill in and was asked to lead several projects again. I love being a Lead Engineer, and had really missed the thrill of being on projects again. 

Here are some of the sites my team and I shipped:

* [Together Stronger](https://togetherstronger.com/)
* [Michael & Susan Dell Foundation](https://www.dell.org/)
* [M365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/) (rebuild)
* [Next.js WordPress Example](https://webdevstudios.com/2020/06/02/building-the-nextjs-9-4-wordpress-example/)
* [Bill of Rights Institute](https://billofrightsinstitute.org)

We also renewed our focus on continuing education for the engineers in 2020. I put together a 3-phase plan to become "[The Best Damn Gutenberg Shop Out There](https://webdevstudios.com/2020/09/08/gutenberg-first/)". 

In addition to projects and cont. edu initiatives we also rolled out a new Website Migration boilerplate, re-wrote the website audit documentation, migrated and re-wrote most our internal documentation, updated our security policy and hired 4 new engineers! 

### Books

I was fortunate enough to be asked to tech edit on not one, but two books in 2020:

* [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](https://gregrickaby.com/books/wordpress-for-dummies-9e)
* [WordPress for Dummies](https://gregrickaby.com/books/professional-wordpress-plugin-development-2e)

These are both major titles in the WordPress space and I'm thankful to Brad and Lisa for asking for my help!

## House Update

When we moved in 3 years ago, this place was a mess. A foreclosed house on 5 overgrown acres. Vines, weeds, and scrub-brush everywhere you looked. This year was all about yard work. My friend Jeremy stopped by last winter and bush hogged about an acre, and I spent the rest of the year cleaning up the rest by hand. Lots of time was spent running a chain saw and burning piles of brush and limbs. \
\
Tara and I also painted the living room, breakfast nook, and kitchen as well as pressure washed the outside of the house, front porch, and pool enclosure. We also bought a nice porch swing, a picnic table, and had Amerigas plumb a gas couple of permanent gas lines for the grill...the pool deck is really coming along nicely!

## Family Travel

Even though I didn't travel for work, we did travel as a family. All of these trips were planned and paid for prior to COVID. We masked up and took the necessary precautions to keep ourselves and others safe.

### Biloxi

Normally when Chloe has a regional dance competition, I stay home with boys. Nationals are a different story though! Last year we headed to Savannah, GA and had an amazing time. This year was Biloxi, MS and it didn't disappoint either.

We stayed a lovely beachside hotel only a few blocks from the competition. Thanks to the new COVID-way of doing dance competitions, we only needed to be on site for a few hours on Saturday and we were done! The girls did really great, coming in 2nd to a dance company from New Orleans. (they came in 2nd last year too, to a team from St. Louis). It's amazing that our tea, from a small town of 30,000 people, can hold their own against teams from major cities! Proud of you girls!

### Northern Wisconsin

We've been going up north to visit my parents the last few years, taking in the beautiful summertime weather and outdoor activities in Florence County. My folks finished building their cabin, which meant we finally had our own place...we stayed for two full weeks and I took all but two of those days off.

We visited Escanaba, went fishing, made some amazing meals, visited several parks and a zoo. It was an amazing trip and really recharged our batteries.

### Duck Hunting

My buddy Clint and I had been talking about this trip for a while. 2020 was finally the year we did it. We were originally going to fly up to Green Bay, WI and duck hunt with my dad, uncle, and cousins. The flying plans were scrapped and we drove up to Florence instead.

It was both Clint and Chase's first time duck hunting, so it was a real thrill for Dad and I to share the experience. We did pretty well, Clint shot a duck on his very first try and I shot a couple more and a goose throughout the week. Even Chase (who doesn't enjoy waking up early) had a blast and can't wait to go back.

### Disney World

This was our third trip to Walt Disney World and second time staying at Disney's Art of Animation resort. Initially, we were worried about being in a crowded theme park during a pandemic, but without a doubt, Disney was not playing around with guest safety. Masks and social distancing were required--everywhere. Violators were asked to leave. There was also extra sanitization going on... industrial sized Lysol spray and cast members constantly wiping down hard surfaces. I can honestly say, we felt safer at the Disney Parks than our local Wal-mart.

We hit up Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Hollywood Studios. With the lower crowds, we were able to see and ride just about everything. With the kiddos being a little older (and experienced) this added to our enjoyment. It was the best Disney World trip yet!

## Goals & Wrap Up

Here are a few things I'd like to work on in 2021:

* Continue getting up early and taking photos
* Continue to push myself with JavaScript
* Spend less time on Reddit
* Finish cleaning up the yard 
* Buy a zero-turn lawn mower
* Finish painting (master bedroom, dining room, upstairs)

I've been saying for years that this family is blessed and if anything, 2020 proved that to be true. We are forever thankful to God for our health, steady work, and financial security. As I stare down the barrel at 2021 (and turning 40) I can't help but think the best is yet to come.

As always, I'll end with my favorite Bible verse(s):

*“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."*
