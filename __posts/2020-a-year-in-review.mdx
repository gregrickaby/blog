Where to begin? A global pandemic, lock-downs, corrupt politicians left unchecked, an election shrouded in turmoil... honestly felt like from a global and national viewpoint, 2020 would never end.

\## Family life

**Wyatt** (4), is still rambunctious and 2020 saw him finally becoming fully potty trained. He still loves dinosaurs, heavy machinery, and "Mando" from *The Mandalorian*. Wyatt doesn't really stop talking, ever! (haha) and is drawing people (as stick figures) and can use scissors, glue, and other craft stuff. He's a great kid with a big heart who is ferocious protective when it comes to his family.

**Chloe** (6), is still dancing and has participated in her 3rd consecutive year with the company at [Center Stage](https://www.centerstagedanceal.com/). Even amid a pandemic, the company traveled to Montgomery, Mobile, and Biloxi to compete at dance competitions. 

Those dance competitions had to be completely overhauled to meet social distancing requirements. My favorite part was the grouping of companies in a single time slot. This mean committing to a few hours on a one day, instead of spread across a 3-day weekend.

Tara and I decided to homeschool this year, we just felt like it was the right choice during the pandemic, plus Tara has the credentials to do so. It hasn't been easy, but Chloe is learning a lot and getting good grades!

**Chase** (15), is still drumming... except now he's on drumming for Enterprise High School's "Big Blue Band". He also got his learner's permit, however, has shown almost no interest in driving. He spends most of his time with video games including Red Dead 2, Skyrim, Assasin's Creed Valhalla, and Animal Crossing.
