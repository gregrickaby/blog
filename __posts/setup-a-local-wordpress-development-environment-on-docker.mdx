As I continue to explore Docker, this post will serve as my notes.

I assume assume you already have the following technologies on your computer or know how to install them:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A terminal app
- Helpful, but optional: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) w/ [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)

## Installation

Clone WordPress:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:WordPress/wordpress-develop.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
$ cd wordpress-develop && npm i
```

Start Docker containers:

```
$ npm run env:start
```

Install WordPress:

```
$ npm run env:install
```

Build WordPress assets:

```
$ npm run build:dev
```

## Where is everything?

Once you're up and running, you can view the local instance of WordPress: [http://localhost:8889/](http://localhost:8889/)

Logging into WordPress is easy enough:
[http://localhost:8889/wp-admin/](http://localhost:8889/wp-admin/)
user: admin
pass: password

You can also open VS Code and inspect the file and directory structure. You should see something similar:

```
 ├── src
 │   ├── js
 │   ├── wp-admin
 │   ├── wp-content
 │   └── wp-includes
 ├── tests
 │   ├── e2e
 │   ├── phpunit
 │   └── qunit
 └── tools
     ├── local-env
     └── webpack
 ├── .editorconfig
 ├── .env
 ├── .gitignore
 ├── etc....</code>
```

The `/src` directory is where WordPress is located. Here, you can work as you normally did using other local development applications like XAMPP, MAMP, or Local by Flywheel.

The `/tests` directory houses all unit tests used by [@wordpress/scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts). You can run tests using NPM.

Finally the `/tools` and root directory are where the scripts for setting up Docker, along with other development related configs are located. You can ignore those.

## Development

Watch for changes:

```
$ npm run watch
```

Run PHP unit tests:

```
$ npm run test:php
```

Run JavaScript unit tests:

```
$ npm run test:e2e
```

Use WP-CLI:

```
$ npm run env:cli
```

_Note:_ Where the documentation mentions running `wp`, run `npm run env:cli` instead. For example, `npm run env:cli scaffold plugin my-plugin --activate`

Check out all the [useful WP-CLI commands](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).

## Other

View Docker log files:

```
$ npm run env:logs
```

Pull the latest versions of containers:

```
$ npm run env:pull
```

Stop the containers:

```
$ npm run env:stop
```

Reset the containers:

```
$ npm run env:reset && npm run env:start
```

_Note: this will destroy the Docker containers and create new ones. Make sure you back up your data first!_

Pruning dangling Docker stuffs:

```
$ docker system prune
```

## Gutenberg Development

If you want to contribute to the development of Gutenberg, connecting it to your new local is very easy.

Clone Gutenberg in a new directory outside of `/wordpress-develop`

```
$ git clone git@github.com:WordPress/gutenberg.git && cd gutenberg
```

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm i && npm run build
```

Set the path to WordPress:

```
$ export WP_DEVELOP_DIR=../wordpress-develop
```

Connect Gutenberg and WordPress:

```
$ npm run env connect
```

If you open up the [WordPress dashboard](http://localhost:8889/wp-admin/plugins.php), you should now see the Gutenberg plugin, tests, and example blocks.

Simply activate Gutenberg and any other plugins that you need. Learn more about [getting started](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/develop/getting-started/), and read about the [Git Workflow](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/develop/git-workflow/).

## Staying Updated

Because both WordPress and Gutenberg are version controlled, you can simply use `git pull` to bring in the latest changes:

```
$ cd wordpress-develop && git pull && cd ../gutenberg && git pull
```

If you want pull in the latest Docker containers:

```
$ npm run env:pull
```
