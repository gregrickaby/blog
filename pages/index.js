        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I&apos;m Greg, a published author, photographer, and an
          owner of a{' '}
          <a href="https://www.packers.com/">professional sports team</a>.
          Welcome to my personal blog where I share my thoughts on web
          development, photography, and I like to throw in some personal stuff
          here and there.
        </p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>
          In 2018, I started to take a deep interest in photography. I bought a
          mirrorless camera and spent months of taking online courses, reading
          books, practicing, and having my work critiqued by peers. What has
          started as an enjoyable hobby, has turned into a passionate way to
          express my creativity and exhaust my bank account!

        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>
          I contract with <em>For Dummies</em> and <em>WROX</em> brands to write
          and edit technical books. I wrote a children&apos;s book in 2017
          titled{' '}
          <a href="https://amzn.to/34QAxAQ" rel="nofollow">
            <em>Creating a Website for Dummies Jr</em>
          </a>
          . It guides the reader through the website planning and development
          process. My book has been translated into other languages, and
          currently has a near 5-star rating on Amazon.
        </p>

        <p>I also served as the Technical Editor for three other books:</p>

        <h3>Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve been part of the WordPress community since 2008. I&apos;ve
          made contributions to core, documentation, plugins, and themes.
          I&apos;ve also spoken at WordCamps and meet-ups. I&apos;m also a
          contributor to other open-source projects like Next.js, Storybook, and
          Gatsby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I volunteer my time and efforts at local community
          organizations. The Boy Scouts, Wiregrass Church, and the Enterprise
          High School Band Boosters to name a few.
